-- Features to add --
kernel: eps2, Xperiodic, wavek -> global variables
bodies -> bodies + fields, bodyPos -> bodies, bodyAcc -> fields
Time each kernel separately using cycle counters
examples/Makefile options to args
cycle counter based weights
OpenMP with atomics -> flush
MPI-3.0 lock all
SIMD P2P performance
Kahan + fixed precision
Solid harmonics kernel
Morton -> Hilbert
splitRange defined in both dataset.h and partition.h
UVWX-list with precomputation
2:1 refinement for precomputation
Periodic B.C. by one precomputed translation matrix
Teng's BH MAC with M2P option during DTT
non-orthogonal recursive bisection

-- GPU integration --
CUDA 6.0 debug
Unify dataset
.h -> .cxx/.cu
MPI Bonsai
Ewald, VdW
Zero softening

-- Comparisons --
DTT vs. UVWX-list
Separate +- tree vs. Single tree
Cartesian vs. Spherical (optimized)
ORB vs. HOT

-- Debugging tips --
Write the kind of code where standard gcc can catch the bug, exceptions, assertions
Add assertions and keep them there
Shift bodies
traverseLET 0 distance
graft 0
serial mimic parallel

-- Issues --
charmm2: remove repartition inside Ewald & VdW
Intel OpenMP error
